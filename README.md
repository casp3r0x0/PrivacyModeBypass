this is a tool I developed to Bypass privacy mode in AnyDesk/team viewer or any software is doing block on screen .

for exmaple somebody access to your PC but he activated blackscreen to block you from see what he is doing you can use this program to record what he is doing without any notice. 
## features 
 - simple usage 
 - run in background without any notice 
 - save the video in current folder 
 - can bypass any blocking mode (over relaying)

## usage 
- download the release https://github.com/casp3r0x0/PrivacyModeBypass/releases/download/v1.0.0/Release.zip
- then extract the file into any folder 
- make sure you have python installed and added to the environment variable means you can call python from cmd directly 
- make sure you installed the following libraries 
```
cv2
numpy 
pyautogui
time
os
```
- to start recording make sure that check.txt is empty.
- run `casp3r.exe` to start recording 
- if you want to stop recording open `check.txt` and  0  as text and save it once you save it the program will save the video in the same folder
